Hello, I'm Logan! :cowboy_hat_face:

I have contributed to the work of [Blinkcns](https://www.blinkcns.com/) (Charleston, SC) for over five years in various roles. Since April I have also been working at [LUMIQ](https://lumiq.tech/) (Charleston as well). In 2023 I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University. My programming experience is primarily in Python, particularly with (big) data infrastructure/manipulation/discovery, machine vision, neural networks, signal analysis, and GIS. I have additional experience in Rust, C++, C, Matlab, Mathematica, and Java (generally ordered in decreasing level of confidence), along with active working knowledge of AWS. 

Let's get in touch. I'm an engineer/leader/artist/generally-bright-person who's always on the hunt for new opportunities.
