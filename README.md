Hello, I'm Logan! :cowboy_hat_face: Currently I'm eyeing my next career move â€” something in engineering, consulting, or management.

I have contributed to the work of [Blinkcns](https://www.blinkcns.com/) (Charleston, SC) for over four years in various roles. Recently I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University. My programming experience is primarily in Python, particularly with (big) data infrastructure/manipulation/discovery, machine vision, neural networks, and edge device computing. I have additional experience in Rust, C++, C, Matlab, Mathematica, and Java (generally ordered in decreasing level of confidence), along with working knowledge of AWS. 

Let's get in touch.
