Hello, I'm Logan! :cowboy_hat_face:

I've worked at [LUMIQ](https://lumiq.tech/) and [Blinkcns](https://www.blinkcns.com/) (both in Charleston, SC). My programming experience is primarily in Python, particularly with data science/infrastructure, machine learning, computer vision, signal analysis, edge devices, and GIS. I have additional experience in Rust, JS, C++, C, Matlab, Mathematica, and Java (generally ordered in decreasing level of confidence), along with active working knowledge of AWS. In 2023 I graduated from Columbia University with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

Let's get in touch. I've got a lot to offer and I'm always on the hunt for new opportunities.
