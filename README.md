Hello, I'm Logan! : )

Recently I completed my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Columbia University. I have contributed to the work of blinkcns (Charleston, SC) for over three years in various roles... My programming experience is primarily in Python, particularly with (big) data infrastructure/manipulation/discovery, machine vision, neural networks, and edge device computing. I have additional experience in Rust, C++, C, Matlab, Mathematica, and Java (generally ordered in decreasing level of confidence).
